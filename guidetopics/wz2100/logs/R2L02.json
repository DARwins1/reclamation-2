		"Simon, I'm sending you this because you were right.",
		"That new gang is big trouble.",
		"",
		"The've been rolling through the streets, block by block, slowly eating up all the smaller gangs.",
		"As you know, this ain't the first time some new group has rolled through town like they own the place.",
		"Normally, I'd say they'll bite off more than they can chew and fall apart within a month.",
		"",
		"But this time, I've noticed two things different with these guys:",
		"First, they've got tech. We're talking guns, full-size tanks, even some of those old flying transports.",
		"That's pre-bomb stuff, I tell you. But it all looks brand-new.",
		"Which means that they're MAKING that stuff, not scavenging it.",
		"And that's how the've been steamrolling through all the little guys.",
		"Almost nobody's got the firepower to punch through all that armor.",
		"",
		"Second, they're moving with purpose.",
		"They're not just raiding and stealing supplies, they're recruiting from the gangs they take down.",
		"Gus told me they even refurbashed the old prison on the other side of town.",
		"He thinks that's where they turn their prisoners into recruits.",
		"Pretty crazy stuff if you ask me",
		"",
		"So send word our friends holed up in that old NASDA base.",
		"Maybe if they make a move now we can take this gang down before they grow out of control."
