		"George, the Collective rolled through another one of our camps today.",
		"You were right, once those tanks broke through the outer gates, there was no stopping them.",
		"It took over a dozen rockets just to take down one.",
		"And by that point, half the camp had been reduced to rubble.",
		"In less than 10 minutes, everyone had either fled, surrendered, or had already been killed off.",
		"They sent them off to one of their bases. Probably off to that old prison they rebuilt.",
		"",
		"But I think you were wrong about their fighters. They're not from the outside.",
		"I recognized some of the faces marching along with their tanks. People I hadn't heard from in weeks, now fighting AGAINST us!",
		"They're not just wiping out the other gangs, they're recruiting them. They're turning us into their own soldiers!",
		"",
		"Jaime was there too, when they attacked. She said she hid under a destroyed buggy for hours until they all left.",
		"She told me that she heard what they were telling the guys that they captured.",
		"They kept preaching about being chosen by some \"Machine\" and that this Machine would grant \"gifts\", as long as they pledged their loyalty.",
		"She thinks that's where the Collective is getting all their tech, from this Machine thing.",
		"",
		"Listen, this city doesn't look so big anymore.",
		"I know you were waiting until we can find a place to go, but we're out of time.",
		"We've gotta pack up everything we still have and get out of here.",
		"I don't care if there's nothing for miles around the city, there's gotta be somewhere to go out there.",
		"Anywhere's better than here right now.",
		"The Collective are just gonna keep eating up this whole city until everyone's worshiping their Machine."
