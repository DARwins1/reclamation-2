		"At the time, I was ecstatic. The Good General himself said that I had saved the day!",

		"It had to be done. That's what I keep telling myself. That's what Clayde had told all of us.",
		"Team Alpha had betrayed the Syndicate for their own interests, and in the process had released a Pre-Collapse bio-weapon that threatened to eat up the entire sector.",
		"They had to be eradicated. And I had to lead them into Clayde's trap.",
		"",
		"Clayde told me I was doing something no one had the guts to do.",
		"Giving orders to Alpha's Commander. Moving their forces out so that Clayde's men could rig those missile silos.",
		"Then telling them to defend those bombs as the Infested poured in.",
		"It was like telling them to dig their own graves.",
		"",
		"This thought keeps nagging at me.",
		"Why did they go along with it?",
		"Team Alpha had already betrayed NARS by then. So why follow my orders, but not the General's?",
		"Was Commander Alpha just trying to buy time and follow along, unaware what Clayde was preparing for them?",
		"Or did they already know what was going to happen, and just accept whatever happened next?",
		"Clayde told me with certainty that Commander Alpha would follow my orders. But why?",
		"Was there something about Team Alpha that Clayde knew and didn't tell us?",
		"",
		"If what Clayde DID tell us about Team Alpha is true, then they deserved what they got.",
		"I just need to keep assuring myself of that."
