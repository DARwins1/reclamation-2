		"June, I've been handling the guys they brought in from NASDA Central.",
		"The guys from the syndicate thingy. You know what I mean.",
		"Lemme just say, these guys are some real odd-birds.",
		"",
		"I know you said that your men were able to co-opt an entire group of those guys, and to that I say:",
		"HOW?",
		"",
		"These guys won't budge! Not a bit!",
		"I give them the ol' recruitment rundown thing we do to everyone, and these guys don't buy it at all!",
		"Normally, the scavs we bring in would be chomping at the bit for some food and bunk to sleep in.",
		"But these guys? Nope!",
		"",
		"I was talking to this important-looking guy we brought in. Name of \"Andies\" or something.",
		"He told me no one would join up, 'cause some \"General\" was coming to free them all.",
		"Fat chance.",
		"I said this General would have already joined us, if he knew what's best for him. But he still wouldn't buy it!",
		"",
		"But here's where it gets weird.",
		"Some of them kept scratchin' the backs of their necks. Over and over.",
		"I thought they were just scared at first, but then I take a look and see one of those new spine plugs!",
		"You know, one of them new techy thingies we're rolling out for the new recruits.",
		"The synapses, or whatever. For the \"true devotees\".",
		"",
		"Anyway, I start looking around, and it's not just one.",
		"Every single one of these guys has a spine plug!",
		"I called it up, said to hold these guys here until the higher-ups can have a look at em'.",
		"But you and I both know that'll take forever.",
		"So how about you come over to the prison and take a look at these guys for yourself?",
		"You've already dealt with some of em', right?",
		"Maybe you can get them to budge."
