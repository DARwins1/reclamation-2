		"Lin, it's Hayley.",
		"We've got the supplies. Pretty easy.",
		"We came in while most of em' were sleeping and nabbed three truckloads before they even knew what happened.",
		"So tell Samuel he can shut his trap about running away.",
		"As long as we play our cards right, and don't get caught out, we can ride this out and still come out on top.",
		"",
		"Those \"Collective\" thugs look like a real military behind their tanks and walls.",
		"But behind all that armor, most of em' are still the same milk-for-brains that we're used to.",
		"A lot of them still act like a gang, too.",
		"Sure, they'll take marching orders from whoever's giving them out up there, and they're scary as hell when they do.",
		"But they're not so organized when they aren't marching along with those tanks.",
		"That's the time when we can work.",
		"",
		"But for the record, tell Jim to stay the hell away from those \"NARS\" guys. You know how he is.",
		"The other day, we thought we could do a fuel raid on one of their bases. In and out, easy stuff.",
		"Not a chance. The moment we got within range, one of their planes started strafing us!",
		"We had to scatter and ditch two of the buggies just to get away.",
		"So make sure everyone knows to steer clear of those guys, they're bad news.",
		"",
		"Though, it doesn't seem that they'll be here for much longer.",
		"They're tightly packed and well-organized, but they're tiny.",
		"The Collective probably outnumbers em' 100 to 1. Maybe even more than that.",
		"So I say, we just wait for the Collective to wipe em' out, then steal the spoils from them!",
		"",
		"As for the Collective, they ain't gonna last forever either.",
		"Once their grunts realize that their \"precious Machine\" ain't so holy after all, half of them will ditch within a week."
