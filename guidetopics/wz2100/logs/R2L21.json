		"One of our squads reported back that they'd seen some movement while on patrol, saying they caught a glimpse of what looked like a vehicle moving between some of the buildings.",
		"I asked why they were bringing this up in particular.",
		"It's not like seeing a stray vehicle is anything noteworthy nowadays. Especially now with those infested Collective tanks.",
		"I guess those zombies don't have enough brain left inside to know when to stop, so they just keep driving them around until the tanks just fall apart.",
		"There's broken down vehicles all over the contaminated sections of the city.",
		"",
		"Anyway, the squad leader claimed that all of their sensor equipment stopped working when they tried to investigate.",
		"So. They came all the way back to report a vehicle, and they didn't even get a picture of it?!",
		"I asked them why they were bothering me if they didn't have anything to show.",
		"Then, one of them handed me this drawing???",
		"",
		"I don't really know what to do with this, but I doubt the Supreme General would care."
